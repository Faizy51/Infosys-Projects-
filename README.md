# Infosys-Projects-
Mini projects created by me as part of campus connect program held by Infosys.

<h3>Note : </h3>
module4.py is a very good and structured python project for basic Account handling functionality.
Please use the mod3.sql file as a database or create your own using the queries in bankDB file.</br>
You need to have SQL developer in your PC.
